My name is Chandan, and I am a B.Tech student specializing in Information Technology. I am passionate about software engineering, with hands-on experience in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and the MERN stack. My strengths include data structures and algorithms (DSA) and strong problem-solving skills.

I have developed a music app store that displays music playlists and fetches data from a backend, showcasing my ability to build full-stack applications. I am always eager to learn new concepts and embrace challenges, driving continuous growth in my journey as a developer.
